# Project 1: [Ghosts in the Maze](https://github.com/vamsikrishna1999/AI-Projects/blob/main/ghosts_in_the_maze/Fall%20520%20-%20Project%201.pdf)  

This project has a few purposes. First, to give you experience implementing and using search algorithms to solve problems. Second, to highlight the difference between planning and execution - a plan may be based on incomplete information, and may need to be updated or adapted as it is executed. In this project you’ll build an environment, an agent that has to interact with that environment in order to accomplish a goal, and you’ll collect data to analyze the performance of your agent in pursuit of that goal.
