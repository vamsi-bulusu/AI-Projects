# Project 2: [The Circle of Life](https://github.com/vamsikrishna1999/AI-Projects/blob/main/circle_of_life/Project%202%20-%20Fall%202022%20CS%20520.pdf)

The purpose of this project is to build a probabilistic model of an environment in the presence of uncertainty, 
and use it to inform and direct decision making. You are pursuing a prey object, while simultaneously being pursued by a predator object, 
and want to capture your target and evade capture yourself. This will be complicated by not necessarily being able to see where the predator 
and prey are - but you must use the information you have to make the most informed decisions you can about what to do.
