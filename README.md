# AI Projects Repository

This repository contains projects completed for the CS520 AI course.

## Projects

1. **Ghosts in the Maze**  
   Implemented search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*) to find shortest paths in a stochastic environment.

2. **Circle of Life**  
   Developed a probabilistic model to guide decision-making under uncertainty.

3. **Better, Smarter, Faster**  
   Used Value Iteration to solve an MDP, then created a neural network to automate state utility calculation.

4. **Similarity Search**  
   Built an unsupervised model to identify similar images.
