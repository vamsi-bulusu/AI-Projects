- Ghosts in the maze: Implemented search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*) to solve problems relating to Short Paths from Goal to Destination in stochastic Environment

- Circle of Life: built a probabilistic model of an environment in the presence of uncertainty, and use it to inform and direct decision making

- Better Smarter Faster:  Implemented Value Iteration to solve MDP and built a neural network to automate the process of finding the utility of a state

- Similarity Search: Implemented a unsupervised model to find similar images
